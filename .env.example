# Hugging Face AI Integration (Optional)
# Get your API token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# This enables AI-powered features like:
# - Advanced code completion
# - Intelligent language detection
# - Code explanation and analysis
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your-huggingface-api-token-here

# Recommended Hugging Face Models (these are set in ai_helper.py):
# - Code Completion: Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono
# - Language Detection: microsoft/codebert-base-mlm  
# - Code Analysis: microsoft/CodeBERT-base
# - Text Generation: microsoft/DialoGPT-small

# Note: AI features work with limited functionality even without the API token
# The system falls back to rule-based language detection and basic explanations
